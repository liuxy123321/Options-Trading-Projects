# Options Trading Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is structured to align with the 16-week roadmap based on *Option Volatility and Pricing* by Sheldon Natenberg. The goal is to build an in-depth understanding of options trading, volatility analysis, and risk management through practical coding projects and conceptual learning. This repository is also intended to serve as a showcase for any companies I am applying to for a Quantitative role, including hedge funds, HFTs, and proprietary trading firms.
